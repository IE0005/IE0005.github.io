- title: "Prediction of mechanical behaviors of L-DED fabricated SS 316L parts via machine learning"
  authors: "Israt Zarin Era, Manikanta Grandhi, Zhichao Liu"
  description: "This study presents data-driven models utilizing XGBoost and Random Forest to predict the tensile properties of the DED process, minimizing the reliance on extensive experimental trials. XGBoost demonstrated superior predictive performance, achieving lower RMSE values of 11.38 MPa for yield strength, 12.22 MPa for ultimate tensile strength, and 3.22% for elongation. Additionally, XGBoost exhibited higher RÂ² values (76%, 72%, and 85%) and lower relative errors compared to Random Forest, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling mechanical behavior."
