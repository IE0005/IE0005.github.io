- title: "Pavement crack detection using Deep learning"
  description: "This project uses deep learning for automated pavement crack detection via semantic segmentation. I trained U-Net (ResNet-34) and SegNet (VGG-13) on the Crack500 dataset, with U-Net achieving 96% accuracy, outperforming SegNet’s 95%. U-Net’s ResNet-34 encoder preserves spatial details better than SegNet’s VGG-13, leading to improved segmentation."

- title: "Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Lung Segmentation and COVID-19 Detection (Ongoing Project)"
  description: "I developed a hybrid deep learning framework using U-Net for lung segmentation, achieving a Dice Similarity Score of up to 96%. Additionally, I implemented Vision Transformers for multi-class classification of COVID-19, Lung Opacity, and Viral Pneumonia from chest X-rays, attaining an average accuracy of up to 95%."
