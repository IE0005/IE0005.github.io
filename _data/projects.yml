  description: "In this project, I am working to handle the class imbalance problem in thermal data using a diffusion model for data augmentation. I utilize a U-Net model with a cosine noise scheduler to generate synthetic samples, aiming to enhance the performance of the Vision Transformer classifier."

- title: "Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Lung Segmentation and COVID-19 Detection (Ongoing Project)"
  description: "I developed a hybrid deep learning framework using U-Net for lung segmentation, achieving a Dice Similarity Score of up to 96%. Additionally, I implemented Vision Transformers for multi-class classification of COVID-19, Lung Opacity, and Viral Pneumonia from chest X-rays, attaining an average accuracy of up to 95%."

- title: "Pavement crack detection using Deep learning"
  description: "This project uses deep learning for automated pavement crack detection via semantic segmentation. I trained U-Net (ResNet-34) and SegNet (VGG-13) on the Crack500 dataset, with U-Net achieving 96% accuracy, outperforming SegNet’s 95%. U-Net’s ResNet-34 encoder preserves spatial details better than SegNet’s VGG-13, leading to improved segmentation."

- title: "Hospital Management Systems Database"
  description: "I designed and implemented an SQLite database to manage hospital operations, including patient records, doctor schedules, appointments, billing, and inventory. The system tracks machine availability and integrates patient-doctor interactions for efficient scheduling. Using Python and the Faker library, I generated realistic synthetic data for patients, doctors, inventory, and appointments. The database enables efficient analytical queries for hospital resource management."
