I am a Ph.D. researcher in Industrial & Management Systems Engineering at West Virginia University, specializing in Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Data Augmentation. My research focuses on bridging the gap between advanced machine-learning frameworks and real-life scenarios with unlabeled & limited labeled datasets for complex applications in additive manufacturing, medical imaging, and more. I develop robust solutions for data augmentation, self-supervised learning, and unsupervised segmentation to handle high-dimensional data effectively.
